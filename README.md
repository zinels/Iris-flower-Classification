# Iris Flower Classification Project ðŸŒ¸

A machine learning project aimed at classifying Iris flower species based on petal and sepal dimensions. This project utilizes Python libraries like **PyTorch** and **Scikit-learn** to implement and evaluate various classification algorithms, achieving high accuracy for real-time species prediction.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and optimizing machine learning models to classify Iris flower species into three categories: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*. The models are trained using the classic Iris dataset, containing 150 samples with four features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

### Key Features
- **Model Comparison**: Implemented logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and decision tree classifiers.
- **Accuracy Optimization**: Improved model accuracy through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Built an interactive web application using **Streamlit** for real-time classification and easy user interaction.
- **Performance Metrics**: Achieved 94% accuracy, showcasing the model's effectiveness in classifying Iris species.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub
