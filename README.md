## Iris Flower Classification Project

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification Project! This machine learning project is designed to classify Iris flower species based on petal and sepal dimensions using various classification models.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these instructions:

1. **Installation**:
 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zinels/Iris-flower-Classification
   cd Iris-Flower-Classification

2. **Dependencies**:
   - This project uses Python and requires libraries such as PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Running the Streamlit App**:
   - Run the app using the following command:
     ```
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - The app will launch in your browser, allowing you to input sepal and petal measurements to classify the Iris species in real-time.

## Usage

The model classifies Iris flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*. Enter the flower's measurements to receive a prediction based on the optimized model.

For example:
- Sepal length: 5.1 cm
- Sepal width: 3.5 cm
- Petal length: 1.4 cm
- Petal width: 0.2 cm

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of **94%**, providing reliable predictions for Iris species classification.
